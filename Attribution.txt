All the liveries herein, and the updated paint kit, are part of a collaborative effort by Flightgear geeks Gary Brown (N-SCOT) and RenanMsV (BR-RVD).  The model that these are fitted for is the Robinson R44 Clipper II / Raven II made by Emmanuel Baranger.  This model can be found at the Helijah Hangar, at http://helijah.free.fr/flightgear/hangar.htm\
\
The work includes a Baker\'92s Dozen (13) new liveries, covering civilian,, police and SAR.\
\
This has been a Scottish - Brazilian collaboration!}
